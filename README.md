# Flappy Bird Clone
A simple clone of the classic game **Flappy Bird** using Python and Pygame. The plan is to eventually use this game, or a variant of it, to test genetic ML algorithms

## Features
- **Control**: Press the spacebar or left-click to jump.
- **Obstacles**: Navigate through randomly generated pipes.
- **Scoring**: Earn points by passing through pipes.
- **Game Over**: The game ends upon collision with ground, sky, or pipe.

## ToDo
- Fix bug where bird is rotated upon game reset
- Fix bug where game automatically starts if reset button clicked too quickly
- Show bird sprite in front of column in case of game over
- Allow user to reset using spacebar
- Add High Score tracking functionality
- Make it so that pipe gaps can generate higher
