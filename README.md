# Flappy Bird Clone
A simple clone of the classic game **Flappy Bird** using Python and Pygame. The plan is to eventually use this game, or a variant of it, to test genetic ML algorithms

## Features
- **Control**: Press the spacebar or left-click to jump.
- **Obstacles**: Navigate through randomly generated pipes.
- **Scoring**: Earn points by passing through pipes.
- **Game Over**: The game ends upon collision with ground, sky, or pipe.

## ToDo
- Minor bug where bird sometimes doesn't jump at immediate start
